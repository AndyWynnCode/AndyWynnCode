- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AndyWynnCode
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in desktop development, but Ive been doing that for years. Far more interesting is the Web landscape, and I have been negligent in learning about it.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.js, along with the stack of Firebase, Node, Express. I'm always learning C#/.NET, in my ongoing an uncompletable quest to know everything.
